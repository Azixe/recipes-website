    <p>Salted eggs are one of those special Asian ingredients. It may not be essential, but every household would have these at some point. These are the yolks of salted eggs, typically duck eggs. They’re cured in salt over a period of time so it’s salty. When you buy the salted eggs from the supermarket, there’s usually a layer of black soil that you would need to rinse off. Once it’s cleaned out, crack the eggs and separate the whites from the yolks. You can actually eat the whites as well, though most people would just use the yolks as an ingredient.</p>

        <li>300g Chicken, cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>

        <li>2 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 stalks of Curry Leaves</li>
        <li>1-2 stalks of Thai Bird’s Eye Chilis or Cili Padi, minced</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <b>Steaming the Salted Egg Yolk</b>
        <li>Steam the egg yolks on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the yolks cook. It will turn a paler yellow and more opaque.</li>
        <li>Mash the cooked yolks with a fork finely.</li>
    </ol>
        
    <ol>
            <b>Shallow Frying Chicken</b>
            <li>To the chicken, season with salt and pepper. Toss through to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch and toss through to coat the chicken pieces with the cornstarch evenly.</li>
            <li>Add enough oil to a pan to shallow fry the chicken pieces. Allow to heat at a medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once oil is hot, add the chicken pieces. Evenly spread across the pan and allow the bottom to cook and crisp up. Flip the chicken pieces over to the other side to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is golden brown and crispy throughout, take off the pan and keep to one side.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ol>
            <b>Making the sauce</b>
            <li>Add butter to a pan, and allow to melt over low heat.</li>
            <li>Once the butter melts, add garlic, curry leaves and bird’s eye chillies. Saute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add mashed salted egg yolks and stir to combine with the butter. The salted egg yolks should begin to foam as it combines with the butter.</li>
            <li>Once you have a combined sauce, add evaporated milk and condensed milk. Option to add salt if needed – you should not need to since salted yolks have enough salt. Stir to combine and allow sauce to come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, add back the fried chicken and toss through to combine.</li>
    </ol>
